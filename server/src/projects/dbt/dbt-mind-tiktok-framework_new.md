|--------------|------------|---------|-------------|
| **Relatable/Emotional** | 50% | Community building, high engagement | Comment-bait on select posts |

| **Tips/Hacks** | 30% | Saves, follows, educational value | Natural integration on last slide |

---

# FORMAT 1: RELATABLE/EMOTIONAL

## Purpose
Validation content. Makes viewers feel seen. Drives comments like "this is me" and "I feel so called out."

## Structure (5-6 slides)

| Slide | Function | Text Style |
|-------|----------|------------|
| 1 | **HOOK** | Curiosity gap, max 12 words |
| 2-4 | **Relatable content** | First-person, hyper-specific experiences |
| 5 | **Emotional landing** | The "and that's why..." or deeper realization |
| 6 (optional) | **Soft app hook** | Only on 1 in 5 posts |

## Hook Formulas

### "Nobody Talks About" (Highest performing)
Creates insider knowledge + curiosity gap

**Formula:** `"nobody talks about [hyper-specific BPD experience]"`

**Examples by topic:**
- FP: "nobody talks about how having an FP is basically emotional hostage syndrome"
- Splitting: "nobody talks about how fast you can go from 'soulmate' to 'enemy' in your head"
- Quiet BPD: "nobody talks about the version of BPD where you implode instead of explode"
- Abandonment: "nobody talks about how fear of abandonment makes you abandon people first"
- Identity: "nobody talks about not knowing which version of yourself is the real one"

### "Hyper-Specific Symptom" (High recognition)
Instant "that's ME" reaction

**Formula:** `"[tiny specific behavior that feels too personal to be universal]"`

**Examples by topic:**
- FP: "checking if they've been online but haven't texted you back yet"
- Splitting: "when they use a period instead of an exclamation mark and suddenly they hate you"
- Quiet BPD: "smiling and nodding while your brain is screaming that everyone secretly hates you"
- Abandonment: "testing whether they'll stay by showing them your worst"
- Identity: "changing your entire personality based on who you're with"

### "Call-Out" (Direct address)
Stops scroll by speaking directly to viewer

**Formula:** `"if you [specific behavior], this is for you"`

**Examples by topic:**
- FP: "if your entire mood depends on one person's texting patterns, this is for you"
- Splitting: "if you've ever mentally ended a relationship over a tone of voice, stay"
- Quiet BPD: "if you've ever had a complete breakdown and no one around you noticed, this one"
- Abandonment: "if you've ever sabotaged something good because you were waiting for it to end anyway"
- Identity: "if you've ever copied someone's mannerisms without realizing it, this is for you"

### "Confession" (Vulnerability)
Creates instant emotional connection

**Formula:** `"I [vulnerable admission about BPD behavior]"`

**Examples by topic:**
- FP: "I know exactly how many hours it's been since they last messaged"
- Splitting: "I rewrote our entire history in my head because they didn't text back fast enough"
- Quiet BPD: "I've never told anyone how close I am to falling apart at any given moment"
- Abandonment: "I push people away and then cry when they actually leave"
- Identity: "I don't know if I actually like this or if I just absorbed it from someone else"

## Slide Text Guidelines

### DO:
- First person ("I", "my brain") not second person
- Hyper-specific situations, not general statements
- Internal monologue revealing hidden experience
- Slight dark humor / self-aware tone
- Use therapy speak naturally (splitting, FP, dissociating, masking)
- Contrast structure (external appearance vs internal chaos)

### DON'T:
- Generic statements ("People with BPD experience...")
- Educational tone
- Advice-giving
- Second person ("You feel...")
- Clinical language without personal framing

### Text Examples

❌ Generic: "People with BPD experience fear of abandonment"
✅ Viral: "rereading our entire text thread 6 times looking for signs he's losing interest"

❌ Generic: "BPD causes emotional dysregulation"
✅ Viral: "going from 'best day ever' to 'I want to disappear' because someone's reply felt off"

## App Mention Strategy (Relatable Posts)

**Use on:** 1 in 5 relatable posts maximum
**Placement:** Last slide only
**Tone:** Personal discovery, not promotion

### Last Slide Text Options:

**For splitting posts:**
"my DBT app calls this 'wise mind' and it's the first thing that actually helped"

**For FP/attachment posts:**
"the DBT app I use has a whole module on this and it finally made sense"

**For emotional spiral posts:**
"my DBT app has a skill for stopping this mid-spiral, wish I knew it sooner"

**For quiet BPD posts:**
"the app I use for DBT actually explains what to do instead of just 'feel your feelings'"

**For abandonment posts:**
"my DBT app breaks this down step by step and it's the only thing that's worked"

### What NOT to say:
❌ "This app is great for this"
❌ "DBT-Mind app really helps! Link in bio"
❌ "Check out this amazing app"

**The difference:** Personal framing + no CTA + benefit tied to emotional content = authentic

# FORMAT 2: POV

## Purpose
Immersive experience content. Puts viewer INTO the BPD moment. Drives watch time and shares (people send to partners/friends to explain their experience).

## Structure (4-5 slides)

| Slide | Function | Visual Direction |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| 1 | **POV Hook** | Establish the scenario |
| 2-3 | **The experience** | Show what happens internally |
| 4 | **The contrast/twist** | External vs internal, or escalation |
| 5 (optional) | **Resolution or continuation** | Leave them in the feeling |

## Hook Formula

**Formula:** `"POV: [specific BPD moment in second person]"`

The "POV:" prefix signals immersive content. Viewer expects to be placed INTO a scenario.

### POV Hooks by Topic

**Favorite Person (FP):**
| Hook | Visual Direction |
|------|------------------|
| POV: your FP left you on read 3 hours ago | Woman staring out window, anxious |
| POV: they finally texted back and your whole day is saved | Dramatic shift, dark to light |
| POV: you're watching your FP talk to someone else | Jealousy/longing, Renaissance style |
| POV: you're trying to act normal while analyzing their every word | Split composition: calm exterior, chaotic interior |

**Splitting:**
| Hook | Visual Direction |
|------|------------------|
| POV: they used the wrong tone and now you're rewriting your entire relationship | Baroque dramatic contrast |
| POV: you went from "I love them" to "I never want to see them again" in 10 minutes | Two opposing portraits |

**Quiet BPD:**
| Hook | Visual Direction |
|------|------------------|
| POV: you're having a complete breakdown and no one around you notices | Serene exterior, hidden chaos |
| POV: someone asks "are you okay?" and you have to decide how honest to be | Two faces, public vs private |
| POV: you're masking so hard you don't even know what's real anymore | Pre-Raphaelite woman, hollow eyes |
| POV: your therapist is the only one who knows how bad it really is | Confessional scene |

**Fear of Abandonment:**
| Hook | Visual Direction |
|------|------------------|
| POV: you're pushing them away to see if they'll stay | Figure turning away while looking back |
| POV: they said "we need to talk" and you've already planned the funeral of the relationship | Romantic painting, impending storm |
| POV: you're testing them again even though you know you shouldn't | Woman at crossroads |
| POV: you finally let someone in and now you're terrified | Vulnerable figure in doorway |

**Identity Disturbance:**
| Hook | Visual Direction |
|------|------------------|
| POV: someone asks what your hobbies are and you genuinely don't know | Blank mirror, faceless figure |
| POV: you're trying to figure out which version of yourself is real | Multiple reflections, fragmented |
| POV: you realized you've been mirroring everyone you've ever been close to | Chameleon transformation |
| POV: you meet someone new and start becoming them without meaning to | Two merging figures |

## App Mention Strategy (POV Posts)

**Use:** Rarely (profile link does the work)
**Why:** POV posts are about the EXPERIENCE, not solutions. Adding app mention breaks immersion.

If you must mention: Do it in the description, not the slides.
**Description example:** "if this is you... my DBT app actually helped me with this 🤍"

# FORMAT 3: TIPS/HACKS

## Purpose
Actionable value content. Positions you as experienced AND helpful. Drives saves and follows. Natural app integration.

## Structure (5-6 slides)

| Slide | Function |
|-------|----------|
| 1 | **Hook** | Promise of practical value |
| 2-4 | **The tips** | DBT skills explained simply, one per slide |
| 5 | **App integration** | Natural "and here's how to practice" |
| 6 (optional) | **Soft CTA** | Save for later, follow for more |

## Hook Formulas

### "Things That Actually Help" (Highest value signal)
**Formula:** `"X things that actually help when [specific BPD moment]"`

The word "actually" does heavy lifting—implies you've tried everything else and THIS works.

**Examples:**
- "3 things that actually help when your FP hasn't texted back"
- "3 things that actually help when you're splitting"
- "3 things that actually help when you're imploding instead of exploding"
- "3 things that actually help when abandonment fear takes over"
- "3 things that actually help when you don't know who you are"

### "The Skill I Wish I Learned Sooner"
**Formula:** `"the skill I wish I learned sooner for [symptom]"`

Regret framing = emotional hook. Implies transformation.

**Examples:**
- "the skill I wish I learned sooner for FP obsession"
- "the skill I wish I learned sooner for black and white thinking"
- "the skill no one talks about for quiet BPD"
- "the skill that stopped me from pushing people away"
- "the skill I wish I learned sooner for identity confusion"

### "What To Do When"
**Formula:** `"what to do when [crisis moment] — from someone who's been there"`

Personal authority + practical value.

**Examples:**
- "what to do when your whole mood depends on one person"
- "what to do before you say something you'll regret"
- "what to do when you're falling apart and can't tell anyone"
- "what to do when you need reassurance but can't ask"
- "what to do when you catch yourself mirroring someone"

### "How I Actually Stop"
**Formula:** `"how I actually stop [symptom] mid-spiral"`

"Actually" + crisis intervention = high save rate.

**Examples:**
- "how I stop spiraling when my FP is distant"
- "how I actually stop mid-split before I ruin everything"
- "how I finally learned to validate my own emotions"
- "how I stop testing people to see if they'll leave"
- "how I'm slowly figuring out who I actually am"

## App Mention Strategy (Tips Posts)

**Tone:** "Here's how to practice what I just taught"

### Why This Works:
Tips content has built-in solution structure. The app mention answers the natural question: "okay but how do I actually DO this?"

### Slide 5 Templates:

**Generic (works for any topic):**
"the DBT app I use walks you through each of these step by step"

**Skill-specific:**
"the app I use has guided exercises for [skill name] — it's the only thing that made it stick"

**Crisis-focused:**
"my DBT app has this as a crisis skill you can pull up in the moment"

**Learning-focused:**
"the app actually explains WHY these work, not just what to do"

# IMAGE CREATION: HIGGSFIELD NANO BANANA PRO

## Visual Strategy Overview

**Why Edward Hopper Style:**
- **Cinematic Solitude:** Hopper's work perfectly captures the "alone in a room" feeling that defines much of the BPD experience.
- **Dramatic Lighting:** His use of harsh light and deep shadows (chiaroscuro) serves as a visual metaphor for splitting and emotional extremes.
- **Urban Realism:** The mid-century American aesthetic feels grounded and "real," making the emotional content feel more personal and less like a historical museum piece.
- **Geometric Isolation:** His compositions use windows and doorways to frame solitary figures, mirroring the feeling of being "trapped" in one's own mind.

## Painting Style Mapping

| BPD Topic | Art Style | Why It Works |
|-----------|-----------|--------------|
| **Splitting** | Edward Hopper - High Contrast | Strong angular shadows and stark lighting = perfect visual metaphor for black/white thinking |
| **Fear of Abandonment** | Edward Hopper - Thresholds | Figures at doorways or windows, looking out toward an empty horizon, dramatic longing and uncertainty |
| **Quiet BPD** | Edward Hopper - Interior Solitude | Figures in contemplation, hidden emotion beneath a still surface, the melancholy of being alone in a room |
| **Identity Disturbance** | Edward Hopper - Cinematic Ambiguity | Uncanny stillness, figures that feel like they're playing a role in a stage-like setting |
| **FP/Emotional Intensity** | Edward Hopper - Night Windows | Intimate focus on single figures in urban settings, capturing the solitude of obsession |
