# DBT-Mind TikTok Scroll-Stopper Framework

A unified system for creating viral TikTok slideshow posts combining topic selection, hook text, and first image into one cohesive scroll-stopping unit.

---

## Part 1: Topic Selection

The topic is the foundation. A perfect hook and image cannot save a boring topic. Choose topics that hit emotional pain points your audience viscerally recognizes.

### Tier 1: Highest Virality Potential (Relationship/Attachment Topics)

These consistently get the highest engagement because they hit the deepest emotional pain points:

#### 1. Favorite Person (FP) Dynamics
- Losing your FP
- Splitting on your FP
- FP dependency/addiction
- What it feels like when your FP pulls away
- The difference between love and FP attachment
- When your FP doesn't text back

**Example hooks:**
- "The truth about your 'favorite person' that no one talks about"
- "Why losing your FP feels like actual death"
- "FP attachment isn't love. Here's what it actually is."

#### 2. Splitting
- What splitting looks like vs feels like
- Splitting on partners/friends
- The "enemy of the state" moment
- Black-and-white thinking in relationships
- When you split on someone you love

**Example hooks:**
- "What a BPD split actually feels like inside"
- "The moment they go from soulmate to enemy"
- "Why you can't see the gray area (and what to do about it)"

#### 3. Fear of Abandonment
- Pushing people away before they leave
- "Can't abandon me if I abandon you first"
- Relationship sabotage patterns
- Why calm feels like rejection
- Testing people to see if they'll stay
- Preemptive rejection

**Example hooks:**
- "Why you push away everyone who gets close"
- "The abandonment wound that controls all your relationships"
- "You're not scared of being alone. You're scared of being left."

#### 4. Relationship Cycles
- Idealization → devaluation
- The breakup cycle (breaking up and going back)
- Why you keep choosing the same people
- Trauma bonding vs actual love
- When love feels like chaos

**Example hooks:**
- "The relationship cycle no one with BPD talks about"
- "Why you keep going back (it's not because you love them)"
- "That's not a connection. That's a trauma bond."

---

### Tier 2: High Virality (Identity/Self Topics)

Strong engagement because they name experiences people can't articulate themselves:

#### 5. Reframes/Uncomfortable Truths
- "You're not empathic, you're hypervigilant"
- "That's not love, that's withdrawal"
- "Your intensity isn't a gift people can't handle"
- Romanticizing survival mechanisms
- Hard truths about BPD behaviors

**Example hooks:**
- "The BPD truth your therapist won't say out loud"
- "Things no one with BPD wants to hear but needs to"
- "Stop romanticizing your trauma responses"

#### 6. Quiet BPD
- Suffering in silence
- Inward vs outward symptoms
- High-functioning masking
- Why no one believes you're struggling
- The invisible struggle

**Example hooks:**
- "Quiet BPD doesn't mean less pain. It means silent suffering."
- "Why no one believes you're struggling"
- "High-functioning doesn't mean okay"

#### 7. Identity/Sense of Self
- Not knowing who you are
- Mirroring others' personalities
- Chronic emptiness
- "Who am I without my emotions?"
- Changing yourself for every relationship
- The void feeling

**Example hooks:**
- "The reason you don't know who you are"
- "You're not 'adaptable.' You're mirroring."
- "That emptiness isn't depression. It's something else."

#### 8. Emotional Dysregulation Explained
- Why you feel everything at 100%
- The nervous system explanation
- Under-regulated vs "too sensitive"
- Why emotions hit so fast and hard
- The difference between emotions and emotional dysregulation

**Example hooks:**
- "You're not 'too sensitive.' You're under-regulated."
- "Why your emotions go from 0 to 100 instantly"
- "Your nervous system never learned to calm down. Here's why."

---

### Tier 3: Medium-High Virality (Recovery/Skills Topics)

These work well when framed as personal experience, not educational content:

#### 9. DBT Skills That Actually Helped
- TIPP skills for crisis moments
- Opposite action breakthroughs
- Radical acceptance realizations
- The skill that finally clicked
- What actually works vs what sounds good

**Example hooks:**
- "The DBT skill that actually stopped my spiraling"
- "I didn't believe this would work. Then it did."
- "Forget everything else. This one skill changed everything."

#### 10. Recovery Milestones
- "6 months ago vs now"
- First time catching yourself mid-split
- Learning to sit with emotions
- Progress that doesn't look like "cured"
- Small wins that matter

**Example hooks:**
- "6 months ago I was on the bathroom floor. Now I catch myself before I spiral."
- "Recovery doesn't look like what you think"
- "The first time I stopped myself mid-split"

#### 11. Therapy Truths
- What therapists won't say directly
- DBT vs just talking about feelings
- Why therapy feels worse before better
- The reality of treatment
- What actually happens in DBT

**Example hooks:**
- "What your therapist is thinking but won't say"
- "Why therapy made everything worse before it got better"
- "DBT isn't about talking. It's about this."

### Viral Content Formats

These formats consistently perform well across all topic tiers:

| Format | Example | Why It Works |
|--------|---------|--------------|
| Translations | "I hate everyone" translation: "I'm terrified everyone hates me" | Names the hidden feeling behind the behavior |
| "Things no one tells you about..." | "Things no one tells you about dating with BPD" | Promises insider knowledge |
| "Signs you might..." / "Signs you don't..." | "5 signs it's a trauma bond, not love" | Specific, actionable, saveable |
| Movie/TV character analysis | "Why [character] is textbook BPD" | Familiar reference point, shareable |
| POV scenarios | "POV: your FP left you on read" | Immersive, relatable, comment-bait |
| "The difference between..." | "The difference between love and FP attachment" | Clarifies confusion, educational value |
| "What it looks like vs what it feels like" | "What splitting looks like vs what it feels like" | Validates internal experience |

---

### Topic Selection Checklist

Before finalizing your topic, ask:

- [ ] Does this hit a specific emotional pain point?
- [ ] Will the audience feel "seen" or "called out"?
- [ ] Is there tension or controversy built in?
- [ ] Can this spark comments (agreement, debate, personal stories)?
- [ ] Does this connect to relationships, identity, or emotions?
- [ ] Is this specific enough to feel fresh, not generic mental health advice?

## Part 3: The First Image (Scroll-Stopper)

The first image must STOP THE SCROLL. It carries the highest energy of the entire slideshow.

Must include **minimum 2** of these elements:

### A. Relatable Authenticity
- Average-looking person, not polished influencer
- Visible imperfection: dark circles, messy hair, no makeup, blotchy skin
- Real environment (see Setting Options below)
- iPhone mirror selfie or front camera selfie (not professional photography)

### B. Emotional Expression (match to hook type)

| Hook Type | Expression |
|-----------|------------|
| Forbidden Knowledge | Knowing smirk, raised eyebrow, "I know something" confidence |
| Specific Number | Calm authority, direct eye contact, teacher energy |
| Pattern Interrupt | Intense, slightly confrontational, truth-bomb energy |
| Transformation | Vulnerable but hopeful, soft strength, survivor energy |

### C. Expressive Gesture
- Hand raised with fingers pointing upward, tense grip like holding invisible ball = "let me tell you something"
- Finger pointing at camera = direct challenge
- Hand on chest = personal/emotional
- Counting fingers = specific number hook

### D. Curiosity/Engagement Element (choose at least one)

| Element | Why It Works |
|---------|--------------|
| Pet in background | Comment bait, softens mood, adds humor |
| Unusual background detail | Makes people look twice, sparks comments |
| Visible emotion (tears, red eyes) | Draws empathy, feels real |
| Contrasting elements | Messy room + confident pose = intriguing |

### E. Setting Options

Choose a setting that fits your hook and topic. The setting should feel real and relatable to your target audience.

| Setting | Vibe | Best For |
|---------|------|----------|
| Bathroom mirror (night) | Raw, 2am crisis energy, harsh lighting | Forbidden knowledge, pattern interrupt, FP/splitting topics |
| Bedroom mirror | Intimate, vulnerable, personal | Transformation, emotional topics, identity topics |
| Car selfie | Casual, "just had a realization" | Pattern interrupt, specific number, quick truths |
| Couch/living room | Relaxed but real, approachable | Specific number, softer topics, recovery content |
| Bed (lying down) | Late night, can't sleep, emotional | Deep emotional content, FP loss, fear of abandonment |
| Kitchen | Everyday life, relatable chaos | Lighter topics, daily struggles |
| Outdoors (golden hour) | Hope, transformation, new chapter | Transformation hooks, resolution, recovery milestones |

## Part 4: Slides 2-6 Image Strategy

### The Core Principle: Slide 1 = High Energy, Slides 2-6 = Calm Progression

**Why this works:**

1. **Authenticity** — Real people don't dramatically change expression every 3 seconds. A subtle progression feels genuine.

2. **Text-image balance** — If both image and text are intense, they compete. Strong text + calm-but-real image = text lands harder.

3. **Viewer fatigue** — 6 slides of intense expressions becomes exhausting and performative.

4. **Let text do the work** — Slides 2-6 deliver the content. The images support, they don't compete.

### Energy Distribution

| Slide | Image Energy | Purpose |
|-------|--------------|---------|
| 1 | HIGH - expressive, gesture, scroll-stopper | Stop the scroll, hook them |
| 2 | Calm - neutral, authentic | Deliver first truth, let text hit |
| 3 | Calm - subtle emotion okay | Deepen the point |
| 4 | Calm - slight shift toward thoughtful | The turn/realization |
| 5 | Calm - gentle warmth | Solution/app mention |
| 6 | Gentle hope - soft smile, resolution | Close with hope, CTA energy |

### Visual Consistency Rules

- **Same person** throughout all 6 slides
- **Same general environment** or logical progression of environments
- **Same pet** if using one (continuity matters)
- **Subtle lighting progression:** dark/harsh → natural/warm (mirrors emotional journey)
- **Expression shifts subtly**, not dramatically between each slide

### Slide 2-6 Expression Guide

| Slide | Expression | What to Avoid |
|-------|------------|---------------|
| 2 | Neutral, direct, calm delivery | Don't match slide 1 intensity |
| 3 | Thoughtful, maybe slightly pained | Don't overact the emotion |
| 4 | Processing, reflective | Don't look confused |
| 5 | Soft recognition, gentle half-smile | Don't look like an ad |
| 6 | Genuine warmth, peaceful, grounded | Don't look fake-happy or over-transformed |

## Part 5: The Complete Formula

**Viral Post = Strong Topic + Matching Hook + Scroll-Stopper Image + Calm Progression**

### Step-by-Step Process:

1. **Choose Topic** (Part 1) → Pick from Tier 1-3 based on virality goals
2. **Match Hook Type** (Part 2) → Select hook framework that fits topic
3. **Design Slide 1 Image** (Part 3) → Expression + gesture + setting + curiosity element
4. **Plan Slides 2-6** (Part 4) → Calm progression, text does the work
5. **Write Slide Text** → Deliver on the hook's promise
6. **Include App Mention** → Slide 4, 5, or 6 (natural integration)

### Example Complete Build:

**Topic:** Splitting (Tier 1 - Relationship/Attachment)
**Hook Type:** Pattern Interrupt
**Hook Text:** "What a BPD split actually feels like inside"

**Slide 1 Image:**
- Expression: Intense, slightly confrontational, truth-bomb energy
- Gesture: Hand raised, tense "let me explain" pose
- Setting: Bathroom mirror, night, harsh lighting
- Curiosity Element: Cat on toilet

**Slides 2-6:**
- Calm expressions, same bathroom/bedroom
- Subtle lighting shift toward warmer
- Text carries emotional weight

**Slide Text Flow:**
1. "What a BPD split actually feels like inside"
2. "One second they're your whole world. The next they're the enemy."
3. "It's not a choice. Your brain literally can't hold both truths at once."
4. "The gray area doesn't exist when your nervous system is in survival mode."
5. "I started tracking my splits on DBT-Mind. Seeing the pattern was the first step to breaking it."
6. "You're not crazy. You're just running on a dysregulated system. And you can learn to catch it. 💜"

## Part 9: Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Topic Mistakes:
- ❌ Generic mental health advice that applies to everyone
- ❌ Topics that don't hit specific BPD/DBT pain points
- ❌ Educational content without personal experience angle
- ❌ Topics that are too niche (no broad relatability)
- ❌ Copying exact topics that are already saturated

### Hook Mistakes:
- ❌ Hook doesn't match topic category
- ❌ Too vague or generic ("Things about BPD")
- ❌ No curiosity gap or tension
- ❌ Trying to use multiple hook types at once

### Slide 1 Image Mistakes:
- ❌ Using a polished/attractive influencer look
- ❌ Professional photography lighting
- ❌ Neutral/passive expression that doesn't match hook energy
- ❌ No curiosity element (nothing to spark comments)
- ❌ Setting that doesn't match topic's emotional tone

### Slides 2-6 Mistakes:
- ❌ Matching slide 1's high energy on every slide
- ❌ Dramatic expression changes between each slide
- ❌ Different person or inconsistent appearance
- ❌ Forgetting the continuity element (pet disappears)
- ❌ Slide 6 looking like a fake transformation or ad

### Overall Mistakes:
- ❌ Images competing with text for attention
- ❌ Too polished = feels like an ad
- ❌ Too rough = uncomfortable to look at
- ❌ No visual progression = static and boring
- ❌ App mention feels forced or salesy

## Part 10: Quick-Start Templates by Topic

### Template A: FP Dynamics Post

**Topic:** Favorite Person attachment
**Hook Type:** Forbidden Knowledge
**Hook:** "The truth about your 'favorite person' that no one talks about"

**Slide 1:** Bedroom mirror selfie, night, knowing smirk, "let me tell you" gesture, cat on bed, dim lighting

**Slide Text:**
1. The truth about your "favorite person" that no one talks about
2. That person you can't stop thinking about? You're not in love. You're in withdrawal.
3. Your brain got addicted to the emotional highs and now their absence feels like death.
4. FP attachment isn't love. It's your nervous system using someone else to regulate.
5. I didn't see this until I tracked my moods on DBT-Mind. The pattern was so obvious once I could see it.
6. Real love doesn't feel like survival. You can learn the difference. 💜

---

### Template B: Splitting Post

**Topic:** What splitting feels like
**Hook Type:** Pattern Interrupt
**Hook:** "What a BPD split actually feels like inside"

**Slide 1:** Bathroom mirror selfie, intense expression, tense hand gesture, cat on toilet, harsh lighting

**Slide Text:**
1. What a BPD split actually feels like inside
2. One second they're your whole world. The next they're the enemy.
3. It's not a choice. Your brain literally can't hold both truths at once.
4. The gray area doesn't exist when your nervous system is in survival mode.
5. I started tracking my splits on DBT-Mind. Seeing the pattern was the first step to breaking it.
6. You're not crazy. You're running on a dysregulated system. And you can learn to catch it. 💜

**Hook:** "Why you push away everyone who gets close"

**Slide 1:** Bed selfie, lying down, raw vulnerable expression with intensity, phone glow lighting, messy sheets

**Slide Text:**
1. Why you push away everyone who gets close
2. "I'll leave before you leave me" isn't a personality trait. It's a trauma response.
3. Your brain learned that closeness = eventual pain. So it preemptively protects you.
4. The sabotage isn't weakness. It's your nervous system trying to control the inevitable.
5. DBT-Mind helped me see when I was pushing vs when there was a real problem.
6. You can learn to stay. Even when it's terrifying. 💜

### Template D: Quiet BPD Post

**Topic:** High-functioning suffering
**Hook Type:** Forbidden Knowledge
**Hook:** "Quiet BPD doesn't mean less pain. It means silent suffering."

**Slide 1:** Bedroom mirror, subdued but intense expression, minimal gesture, soft lighting, cat nearby

**Slide Text:**
1. Quiet BPD doesn't mean less pain. It means silent suffering.
2. You don't explode outward. You implode inward. And no one sees it.
3. "You seem so put together" while you're falling apart inside.
4. High-functioning doesn't mean okay. It means you learned to hide.
5. DBT-Mind gave me a place to track what I couldn't say out loud.
6. Your pain is valid even if no one else can see it. 💜

### Template E: DBT Skills Post

**Topic:** Skill that actually worked
**Hook Type:** Specific Number / Transformation
**Hook:** "The 1 DBT skill that actually stopped my spiraling"

**Slide 1:** Couch selfie, calm authority expression, one finger raised, natural daylight, notebook visible

**Slide Text:**
1. The 1 DBT skill that actually stopped my spiraling
2. It's not meditation. It's not journaling. It's TIPP.
3. Temperature. Intense exercise. Paced breathing. Paired muscle relaxation.
4. When you're in crisis, you can't think your way out. You have to change your body first.
5. I practice this in DBT-Mind whenever I feel myself escalating. It actually works.
6. Your brain can be rewired. But you have to meet it where it is. 💜

### Template F: Recovery/Transformation Post

**Topic:** Progress over time
**Hook Type:** Transformation
**Hook:** "6 months ago I was on the bathroom floor. Now I catch myself before I spiral."

**Slide 1:** Window light selfie, soft hopeful expression, hand on chest, warm golden lighting, gentle smile

**Slide Text:**
1. 6 months ago I was on the bathroom floor. Now I catch myself before I spiral.
2. Recovery isn't linear. Some weeks I still fall apart.
3. But now I know the warning signs. I feel the split coming before it takes over.
4. The gap between trigger and reaction? That's everything. And it can be learned.
5. DBT-Mind helped me track my patterns until I could finally see them in real time.
6. You're not broken. You're just learning a language your nervous system never got taught. 💜

```

### Format Rules

**Slide Text:**

- Each slide on its own line
- Slide 5 or 6 should contain natural app mention ("DBT-Mind app"). Important to say "app" so users know its an Android and iOS app
- Slide 6 ends with a heart emoji 💜

**Image Prompt 1 (Scroll-Stopper):**
- Always in JSON format
- Includes all elements: subject, pose, accessories, photography, background
- High energy expression and gesture matching hook type
- Must include curiosity element

**Image Prompts 2-6 (Calm Progression):**
- Normal text prompt format (not JSON)
- Describes selfie type, setting, expression, lighting
- Maintains visual consistency with Image 1 (same person, same pet, same environment)
- Follows the lighting progression: harsh/dark → soft/warm
- Expressions stay calm, not matching slide 1 intensity

### Example Final Output

**Slide Text:**

```
Slide 1: The BPD truth your therapist won't say out loud
Slide 2: You're not "too sensitive." You're under-regulated. Your nervous system never learned to return to baseline because it was always waiting for the next threat.
Slide 3: That person you can't stop thinking about? You're not in love. You're in withdrawal. Your brain got addicted to the chaos and now calm feels like rejection.
Slide 4: "Healing" isn't feeling less. It's feeling everything AND choosing what you do next. That gap between emotion and action? That's the whole game.
Slide 5: I didn't get this until I started tracking my episodes on DBT-Mind. Seeing my triggers mapped out over weeks finally showed me the pattern I was too deep in to notice.
Slide 6: You're not broken. You're just running survival software that's outdated. Time to update. 💜
