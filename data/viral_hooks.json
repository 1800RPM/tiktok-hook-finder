    "hook_text": "I have diagnosed borderline personality disorder. And today I wanna talk to you about the favorite person, or the FP. So there are four types of FP relationships that we can engage in. These kinds of relationships that I'm about to describe are not mutually exclusive. And that means that we can experience more than one type of FP relationship with one person. For example, I flip with my mother between a few of these, and then my partner started as one and has now transitioned to another type of FP. And in researching for this video, I actually Learned that the definition of an FP is it's not a best friend. It's not even necessarily somebody you love or in a romantic situation with somebody that we look to for emotional dependence. Every move they make defines how we feel. They're providing a sense of emotional validation for us. We have a lot of these, like, pains and worries inside of ourselves of, um, not being good enough, not being worthy or be likable in general. And those anxieties kind of cause us to wager our life. We're looking for proof of the fears that we have or the paranoia that we're experiencing. Everything around us is kind of gauged on how it relates back to us. We are the flip coin of narcissism. And that is something that I will talk about in a future video. Let's not focus on that too much. So what the FP does, For us, initially, is offers a sense of security and safety and understanding, which is something that we're constantly seeking out, I'm kind of constantly working against. But that safety and security is not stable, because it's based in the idealization of a person. And that is expectation of 100% fulfillment, 100% dependency, and it's just not possible. We're gonna dive into the four types of FP relationships that we'll engage in or that we will construct. Type 1 is the roller coaster. You're in a constant state of splitting with the roller coaster relationship. So it's that extreme idealization and devaluation. That idealization is the construct that we create of a person. That devaluation is going to be, we feel unsafe, we feel insecure, we feel like we're not being understood. Small things are going to trigger the devaluation. You know, disagreeing over something, not getting a text back in a timely manner, not getting the type of response you want from an interaction. Now, the split may or may not be one that we project onto other people. However, it will be harsh. We will experience it deeply. The idealization is like the happiest we've ever been. Just a high, a high of all time. And then when we experience an insecurity from them, or we sense anything difficult coming from them, it is devastating. Is the most painful thing, I think, a human being can experience. When we realize this person is not going to be the Fulfillment. They're not going to be able to disprove all the fears we have about ourselves. We plummet into a hit of despair, and this is where we start engaging in really dangerous behaviors. I have a lot of scars that I hate very much, and I have been clean for, honestly, I don't even know how long. Yeah, I've been clean long enough. Type 2. Distorted others. This is typically going to be a platonic relationship, and you don't necessarily have to know this person super well. What it is, is a deep bond to the construct of a person. But this can happen with celebrities or acquaintances or people that were just really putting on a pedestal, living in a way like we know them, but it's the person that we have created. It's not necessarily based in reality. And that person we create is kind of what we need and what we're looking for. We will go through conversations and experiences with them, and we'll have an emotional reaction to those, and we will start to believe that this is the person we're interacting with. That one is not as common for me, but I have experienced all four of these. We do ultimately meet that person, or we do ultimately see the flower, get to know them, and they're not this person we've made. We feel extremely betrayed, and it can cause a spiral. Absolutely. Type 3. Testing and confirming. This one is hard. It is Needing someone so bad that it is physically painful when they are not there or they do not show up for us, our emotions get translated into physical pain. We experience emotions on another level. It is intense. Sometimes you literally wanna rip your body open and crawl out of your skin. That's the best way I can describe it. If they love me, they'll stay. If I do this, we're kind of testing. We're testing a lot. Often be apologizing for every little thing. We might cause a fight to test the relationship and see if they'll stay with us. And what we end up doing is creating the very thing that we are terrified of. And it confirms everything we just despise about ourselves. That's where it leaves us. Kind of paradoxical. Now, the fourth and final type of FP is the missing internal part. This is a person that we will consume like a drug. You will get some attention from them and feel good for a while, feel sustained. And then we will kind of slowly decline and the world will kind of fall apart. There's kind of a cease and desist that happens inside. And you'll need a source again, a source of happiness, a source of purpose, a source of joy. And we will look for that in other people. Things kind of crumble without an external anchor. Not for everybody. For me, yes. For others, they actually find stability and solitude. Wouldn't that Be nice. Just kidding. It's none of it's great, but we kind of look to this person like they're the missing puzzle piece. And we are separated from them for a long period of time. There's this emptiness that we consistently feel. But we feel like we can put them into that hole and that we will feel fulfilled. Um, I've experienced this FP relationship. Emotionally. Did not feel attached. They were going to be the thing that was going to make me better. I projected everything onto them and kind of. I don't know, that was a weird one cause I didn't need them, but I needed the attention. Looking for somebody to complete us, to fill that void, to be the missing link, person who's gonna treat us the best, who's going to fix the thing. And when we lose that, we lose anchor, we crumble, things get weird. Just to recap the four types of FP relationships. The borderline experiences, the roller coaster. Highest of highs, the lowest of lows. The distorted other construct of a person that we may or may not know that we have created. Testing and confirming, constantly chasing a confirmation that we're worthy of love, that we are good enough. Then type 4, the missing internal part, the person we are reaching out for to mend the hole, to plug the hole at the bottom of the ocean. Let me know how many of these you experience, which ones you experience more. Often. Let me know if you are an FP. I would love to know what it's like. It probably sucks. Thanks for showing up today. I hope you Learned something. I hope you Learned like I did. Again, let's keep it a safe space. We're going to be kind to each other. If you are not, you will be blocked. This is a space for people with BPD and people who wanna learn about BPD. Well, I am your crazy Ex girlfriend. I will see you next episode. Thank you so much for watching.",

Sometimes you're wondering, er, what is happening with this man? Is he really there or is he not there? Because I'm not getting it. Now, number one, when the man stops communicating, this is one thing to, just to show you clearly that this man is just done with the relationship. You know, think about it. He used to talk about everything. He used to tell you so many things. Now it's all silence. It's all short replies and is all about ignoring you completely. This man is done with the relationship. He's only holding on a thin line, trying to find a way of escape. And probably he's trying to find who can come through and, you know, be the one. So you're just there being held until he finds the right person. No. 2, he doesn't show affection anymore. Hmm, your man used to show you affection, but now all of a sudden, affection is gone. No kisses, no hugs, er, no, the, I miss, you know, all those kind of things, the warmth, everything gone. What is happening? He's just barely holding on, on a thin rope. And, uh, at this moment, he's just waiting for the, for the sign to get out. Those are some of the things that you will be able to know. No. 3, he prioritizes everything but you. It is only you that he doesn't prioritize. Everything else is in his schedule. He knows, you know, about his friends, his work. He prioritizes even his phone. Ah, he knows when to call this and that, but he will never call you anything. But time with you is only what he doesn't have. You are no longer his focus. That's the reason why he's behaving like that. Alright, again, he gets easily irritated. Have you seen this? That your man all of a sudden he's just so irritated by everything, then you wonder what is wrong. Everything you say or you do suddenly annoys him. Hmm, alright, and he basically just picks fights just to create distance over and over again. Then what is this meaning? It is basically meaning that he is tired of everything. And this one also applies to the other gender as well. Also you as a man, when you see your woman is behaving like this is equally the same. This is not just about men only. And if you're going through this, I know it may seem to be very painful experience. Let me tell you, my brother or my sister, there's always a way out and that's where I come in. Talk to me. I'll show you how to be able to navigate your life before it all culminates on you. Go to the link on my profile bio book in a session and I'll talk to you. I'll help you out. To be able to navigate this tiring and, uh, worst session of time that you're in. And as well, every Friday 5 to seven PM I also have master classes to help you teach you in a diluted way, uncensored way to help you become the best version of yourself.

    "hook_text": "Listen to this real quick. The fundamental trait of all toxic relationships is this that you are willing to put up with pain, even a lot of pain, to avoid feeling an even bigger pain. And most people fall into these two core archetypes, which are people that I coach regularly. The first person is a people pleaser. Can also be called an empath or codependent. They put up with a lot of pain. The pain of being neglected, not having their needs met, putting others before them. And as a result of that, they hold a lot of resentment inside them. Self credent, by the way. Now, these behaviors are survival strategies used since childhood so that they can prevent an even bigger pain from happening. And that bigger pain, and all of that that I just mentioned is a pain of abandonment and shame. Now, the second archetype is the high reactive controller type. They tend to be very emotional and get easily unregulated and can be controlling and narcissistic. They put up with the pain of not being heard, not validated, ignored, and not seen. Again, this is from their childhood, which is an attempt to avoid an even bigger pain. That big pain is also abandonment and rejection. That you can take a moment right now, notice the pains and the resentments and the stuff that you put up with, whether in this relationship or past. What is it preventing you from feeling? And that bigger Deeper pain that you don't really want touch. That thing holds a key to your freedom. If you were to face it and stop running away from it.",

But once you part ways, they seem to disappear from your life. They rarely text first, almost never call. Even with family, they keep a polite distance. As long as there's no real world overlap, the connection fades quickly. In psychology, people like this are often described as having an avoidant attachment style. On the surface, they seem adaptable, socially smooth, able to get along with almost anyone. But deep down, they struggle to truly trust others and they rarely let people get close. That's why they don't enter deep intimacy easily or quickly. If you want to truly reach their inner world, it often takes a very, very long time, years, sometimes even a decade. But once they decide a relationship matters, whether it's friendship or love, they tend to be extremely loyal and long lasting. They don't approach easily, but once they do, they're often willing to spend a lifetime maintaining that bond. Do you have someone like this around you, someone who isn't proactive but loves deeply and for a long time?",

    "hook_text": "These two attachment styles often find themselves in a push-pull dynamic, each trying to cope with fear and uncertainty in their own way, but often without fully understanding the other. If you identify with the anxious attachment style, you might find yourself seeking reassurance, feeling insecure, and fearing abandonment in relationships. You long for closeness and connection, but sometimes your need for validation can feel overwhelming, both to yourself and to your partner. On the other hand, if you lean toward the avoidant attachment style, you might struggle with intimacy, feeling uncomfortable with emotional closeness, and pushing people away to maintain independence. You may fear being overwhelmed by emotions and retreat when things get too close. These contrasting styles can create a cycle of misunderstanding. The anxious partner might feel rejected or abandoned when the avoidant partner pulls away, while the avoidant might feel suffocated by the anxious partner’s need for closeness. But here’s the truth: understanding these dynamics is the first step to breaking the cycle. Healing begins when both partners recognize their attachment patterns and work together to create a balance, one where emotional needs are respected, communication is open, and vulnerability is met with understanding. If you’ve been caught in this cycle, remember: awareness is power. By working on your own triggers and building trust, healing and growth are possible. #foryoupage #AnxiousVsAvoidant #AttachmentStyles #HealthyRelationships #EmotionalHealing #RelationshipAwareness",

We’re told to “calm down” or “take a breath,” but when your nervous system is activated, those things aren’t always accessible, especially if you don’t know what your body actually needs. Self-regulation isn’t about being calm all the time. It’s about understanding your system, noticing what state you’re in, and learning how to support yourself through it. Not to fix it, not to avoid it but to move through it in a way that’s grounded and safe. Because you don’t need to be “less sensitive” or “more in control.” You just need the right kind of support.",
